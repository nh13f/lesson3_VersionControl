            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control stores a history of the changes made to a file or group of files that the developer can reference back later.  When changes are being made to these file and problems start to occur, the developer can reference previous version to see where the problem occurred or revert back.  Each version is time stamped and encoded with the developer who made the changes.  Although version control is integrated into many different applications such as spreadsheets and word processors, version control system (VCS) is the most well-known stand-alone application used for version control.  Tools such as these are necessary for projects involving multiple developers.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In 2005, Git was developed by Linux kernel developers such as the famous Linus Torvalds.  Git is a software development source code management system.  It is also a version control system that proves itself useful on the basis of speed, security and more.   Another unique aspect of Git is that it is a complete repository that has a full history and version-tracking capabilities, outside of a central server.  Git is also locally enabled, easy to learn and is designed for team-centric collaboration.  It allows multiple developers to work at the same time and merge their changes to the files together completely.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Add .</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To add a file’s contents into the index, one would use the “git-add” command.  This add command allows the developer to update the index with the a new or improved version of those files.  Normally, the whole file is updated, but some forms of the “add” command will allow the user to only update the changed parts of the files.  In doing this, unnecessary paths will be deleted from the working tree.  The add commend can be utilized more than once before a “commit”.  Overall, the add command can be used to add a file, path, or a directory and adds it recursively into the existing directory.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Push</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To update remote references with associated objects, the “git-push” command is normally used.  Push changed the repository from a local to remote.  In other words, push updated remote references with the use of local references, while still sending the required objects that are needed to complete the references or “refs”.   Add, commit and push are some of the most important commands that you can use within git.  Unlike add, which is used to update file information, and push, that allows the developer to change from a local repository to a remote repository, commit will allow the developer to store the changes made in the staging area.</p>

        <div class="featurette" id="topic5">

                <span class="text-muted">Pull</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The pull command is another important command to know when first staring to use git.  This command is utilized when the developer wants to “pull” the changes in a remote repository to a local repository.  The pull command is essentially the opposite of “git-push”.  Our local repository in our case would be Cloud 9 while out remote repository would be GitHub.  “git pull” is actually the shorthand version of “get fetch” which normally proceeds “git merge fetch_head”.  More specifically, git pull runs git fetch with the certain constraints and calls “git merge” to integrate the selected branch heads into one branch.</p>
